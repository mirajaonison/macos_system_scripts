# macos_system_scripts
macOS System scripts easing my life. Mostly AppleScript I developed with Automator. 
The scripts I implemented so far : 
* New File : an AppleScript that creates a new txt file inside a folder
* (Un)Hide elements : the script hides or unhides folders or files, using the chflag script. 
* homedns command : Bash command callable from spotlight to change my dns to Cloudfare in order to block porn and known harming websites
* workdns command : Bash command that empties the DNS settings to let default DNS for office or college
